        <h1>Krypnotes Support</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Krypnotes support page. We're here to help you get the most out of your secure note-taking experience.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">I forgot my Master Passphrase. Can you help me recover it?</p>
            <p>
                For your security, Krypnotes operates on a "zero knowledge" principle. We never have access to your Master Passphrase. Therefore, <strong>we cannot recover or reset it for you.</strong> The only way to regain access if you forget your passphrase is by using the <strong>Recovery Key</strong> you were prompted to save during setup. If you have also lost your Recovery Key, unfortunately, your encrypted data will remain permanently inaccessible.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">Is my data safe? Where is it stored?</p>
            <p>
                Your data is extremely safe. All of your notes, folders, and tasks are stored locally and only on your device. Nothing is sent to our servers. When you protect a note or create a backup, the data is encrypted on your device using industry-standard AES-256 encryption derived from your Master Passphrase.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">How does the Encrypted Backup work?</p>
            <p>
                The backup feature bundles all your notes and folders into a single file, encrypts that file with your Master Passphrase, and then allows you to save it wherever you'd like (e.g., your device's files, a cloud service). To restore from this file, you will need to provide the same Master Passphrase it was created with.
