                <p class="faq-question">What is KrypNotes?</p>
                <p>KrypNotes is a secure, offline-first note-taking application designed to help you capture and organize your thoughts, tasks, and important information with complete privacy. It offers a rich-text editor, folder organization, a built-in to-do list, and powerful security options to keep your notes safe on your device.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">How do I create my first note?</p>
                <p>From the main 'Inbox' screen or from within any folder, tap the floating `+` (plus) button at the bottom. This opens the note editor where you can add a title and start writing. Your progress is saved automatically when you leave the screen.</p>
            </div>
             <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">How do I use the To-Do list?</p>
                <p>Tap the 'To-Do' icon in the bottom navigation bar. You can add a new task by typing in the input field at the bottom and tapping the send icon. You can mark tasks as complete, delete them by swiping, set reminders with alarms, and use the dropdown menu at the top to filter your view.</p>

            <h3>Your Privacy Comes First</h3>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">Where is my data stored? Is it private?</p>
                <p><strong>Yes, your data is completely private.</strong> This is the core principle of KrypNotes. All your notes, folders, and tasks are stored <strong>exclusively on your device's local storage</strong>. The app is designed to work completely offline. We do not have servers, and none of your personal data is ever sent to us or any third party.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">Do you have access to my Master Passphrase or my notes?</p>
                <p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong> We operate on a "zero-knowledge" principle. Your Master Passphrase and the content of your notes are yours alone. We have no way to see, access, or recover them. This ensures the highest level of privacy but also means you are solely responsible for remembering your Master Passphrase.</p>

        <!-- Security Section -->
        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>Security, Privacy & Locking</h3>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">What's the difference between 'App Lock' and the 'Master Passphrase'?</p>
                <p>They are two separate security layers for different purposes:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>App Lock</strong> is a convenience feature that locks the entire application when you open it. It uses your device's built-in security (like Face ID, Fingerprint, or PIN).</li>
                        <li><strong>Master Passphrase</strong> is a core security feature used to encrypt your backup files and to act as a password to unlock and view 'protected' notes inside the app.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">How do I protect an individual note?</p>
                <p>This feature locks a note, requiring authentication before its content can be viewed. First, set up a Master Passphrase in `Settings > Security`. Then, open a note, enter <strong>Edit Mode</strong>, and tap the <strong>lock icon</strong> in the app bar. This controls *access* to the note within the app; it does not encrypt the individual note's content as it is stored on your device.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">Do I have to authenticate every time I view a protected note?</p>
                <p>No. When you first authenticate, you start a <strong>secure session</strong>. This session remains active for 5 minutes of inactivity, during which you can view any protected note without re-authenticating. After 5 minutes, the session locks automatically.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">What if I forget my Master Passphrase? Can it be recovered?</p>
                <p><strong>No, we cannot recover your passphrase.</strong> Because we never see or store your passphrase, if you lose it, you will lose access to your protected notes and will not be able to restore encrypted backups. <strong>It is critical that you store your Master Passphrase in a safe and secure place.</strong></p>

        </div>

        <!-- Backup & Restore Section -->
        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>Backup & Restore</h3>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">How do I create a backup?</p>
                <p>First, ensure you have a Master Passphrase set up. Go to `Settings > Data & Backup` and tap `Create Encrypted Backup`. After you authenticate, you can share the backup file or save it directly to your device.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">Is my backup file secure?</p>
                <p>Yes. The backup file is a single `.kryp` file containing all your data, which is <strong>fully encrypted using your Master Passphrase</strong>. Without that specific passphrase, the file is unreadable.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question">How do I restore from a backup?</p>
                <p>Go to `Settings > Data & Backup` and tap `Restore from Backup`. Select your `.kryp` file, and enter the Master Passphrase that was used to create it. The app will intelligently merge the data without creating duplicates.</p>
