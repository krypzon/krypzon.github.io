        <h1>Privacy Policy for Krypnotes</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Our Core Privacy Principle: Zero Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
            Krypzon ("we", "us", "our") built Krypnotes with your privacy as its highest priority. Our architecture is designed to be "zero knowledge," which means we, the developers, have absolutely no access to the content of your notes, tasks, or other personal information.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Everything you create in Krypnotes is stored exclusively on your device.</strong> Your data is never uploaded to our servers. Locking access to protected notes and encrypting backups is handled on your device using your Master Passphrase, which we never see, store, or have access to.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name, email address, or other contact information.</li>
            <li>The content of your notes, folders, or tasks.</li>
            <li>Your Master Passphrase.</li>
            <li>Your location data.</li>
            <li>Unique device identifiers (other than for non-personal diagnostics you may choose to send to support).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How Your Data is Handled on Your Device</h2>
        <p>Krypnotes processes data locally on your device in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note, Folder, and Task Data:</strong> All your notes, folders, and task lists are stored in a local database (Hive) on your device's private storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Speech-to-Text:</strong> If you use the voice dictation feature, the app utilizes your device's built-in speech recognition service (provided by your device's operating system). Your audio is processed by the operating system to transcribe it into text; Krypnotes does not store or transmit your voice recordings.</li>
            <li><strong>Biometric Authentication:</strong> If you enable App Lock or Biometric Unlock for notes, the app interfaces with your device's secure hardware (e.g., Face ID or Fingerprint sensor) via system APIs. Krypnotes never has access to your actual biometric data.</li>
            <li><strong>Encrypted Backups:</strong> When you create a backup, your notes and folders are encrypted on your device using your Master Passphrase before the file is created. This encrypted file can then be saved or shared by you. We cannot decrypt these files.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Krypnotes utilizes certain third-party packages to provide its functionality. These services operate under their own privacy policies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flutter & Dart:</strong> The application is built using Google's Flutter framework.</li>
            <li><strong>Hive:</strong> Used for fast, on-device database storage.</li>
            <li><strong>flutter_quill:</strong> Powers the rich text editor.</li>
            <li><strong>speech_to_text, local_auth, package_info_plus:</strong> Packages that interface with native device APIs for core functionality. None of these transmit personal data to us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            You are in full control of your data's security. When you set a Master Passphrase, you are creating the only key that can unlock your protected content and decrypt your backups. Because we operate on a zero-knowledge basis, <strong>we cannot help you recover a forgotten Master Passphrase.</strong> Losing your Master Passphrase will result in the permanent loss of access to your protected notes and any encrypted backups. We strongly urge you to store your passphrase in a secure location, such as a trusted password manager.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Krypnotes is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us through our support page.</p>
